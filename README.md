Projet still under development

## General description

This project aims at building and IPFS pinning overlay to ensure data replication and efficient storage use over a set of nodes. Unlike other pinning services such as Filecoin that rely on a cryptocurrency and blockchain to allow nodes to reserve storage space on each other, we aim to implement a bartering system.
